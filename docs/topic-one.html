  <div class="one-text">
    <p>HTTP is how the server and the information on the Internet communicate, allowing users
      to share and interact with it. Berners-Lee outlined HTTP to have certain functions
      such as finding an index search in a “hypertext archive”, redirecting a client to another
      server, “format negotiation”, and operating the file transfer
    <span class="one-highlight">(O'Reilly Media, 2015).</span></p>

    <br>

    <p>Some key features of HTTP 0.9 were the “client-server” protocol, ASCII protocol, plain
      text request and response from hypertext, HTML, and documents
    <span class="one-highlight">(O'Reilly Media, 2015).</span></p>

    <br>

    <p>From 1991 to 1995, HTTP/1.0 introduced new features like multiple sets of header fields,
      responses that do not have to include hypertext, and responses that can now start with a
      status line <span class="one-highlight">(O'Reilly Media, 2015).</span></p>

    <br>

    <p>HTTP/1.1 was released publicly in 1997; it offered features such as improvements on previous
      contents and focused more on performance optimizations like “byte-range requests” and
      “caching mechanisms” <span class="one-highlight">(O'Reilly Media, 2015).</span></p>

    <br>

    <p>HTTP/2 was soon introduced in 2012, and there was an update to the transport
      performance <span class="one-highlight">(O'Reilly Media, 2015).</span></p>

    <br>

    <p>The current update is HTTP/3, and a key factor of this update is that it runs on QUIC
      <span class="one-highlight">(Quick UDP Internet Connections)</span>, which will help the consistency
      and speed of a network <span class="one-highlight">(GeeksforGeeks, 2025).</span> Overall, it took a
      lot of dedication and improvement, which led to the current HTTP operating efficiently.</p>
